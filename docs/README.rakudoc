=head1 NAME

B<RakupodObject> - Provides a routine to extract the '$=pod' object
from an external Rakupod source (a file or a string)

=head1 SYNOPSIS
=begin code :lang<raku>
use RakupodObject;
my $pod-object = extract-rakupod-object $file;
=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<RakupodObject> is a module that enables easy access to the Rakupod
object represented by the Raku variable C<$=pod>. That variable, which
is a C<Pod::Block> object, holds the complete, compiled Rakupod tree
extracted from a Raku source file (or string). (It is the same as the
C<$=pod> object used by code inside that source file.)

It is used by external programs whose purpose is to process the
Rakupod into other objects, primarily other forms of
documentation. See the Raku docs for a complete description of the
various C<Pod::Block> subtypes and their attributes.

The module exports one subroutine:.

=begin code
sub extract-rakupod-object(
    $pod-source # file or string
    --> Pod::Block
) is export  {...}
=end code

=head1 Warning

The exported routine uses pragma C<MONKEY-SEE-NO-EVAL> so, as is
mentioned in the Raku docs, the user is warned of the possibility of
system compromise with malicious code in the C<EVAL>ed string.

=head1 Credits

The author is indebted to the Raku expert B<Vadim Belman> (AKA
C<@vrurg>) who provided the routine during the construction of some
Rakupod tests several years ago. The routine, in its original form,
can be seen in file
L<https://github.com/raku/roast/blob/master/S26-documentation/12-non-breaking-space.t>.
