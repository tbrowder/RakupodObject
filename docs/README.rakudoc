=head1 NAME

B<RakupodObject> - Provides a routine to extract the '$=pod' object from an external Rakupod source

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use RakupodObject;

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<RakupodObject> is a module that enables easy access to the Rakupod
object represented by the Raku variable C<$=pod>. That variable holds
the compiled Rakupod tree in a Raku source file. It is used by external
programs whose purpose is to process the Rakupod into other objects,
primarily other forms of documentation.

The module exports two multi subroutines.

=item multi sub extract-rakupod-object(IO::Path:D $pod-file) is export  {...}

=item multi sub extract-rakupod-object(Str:D $pod-string) is export  {...}

=Credits

The author is indebted to the Raku expert B<Vadim Belman> (AKA
C<@vrurg>) who provided the routine during the construction of some Rakupod
tests several years ago. The routine, in its original form, can be
seen in file
